Scenario: A person other than the insured or broker reports a loss. In this case, Henry Adams, a property manager for Lakeside Inn, submits the FNOL after a small electrical fire at the property. However, Henry enters an incorrect policy number during reporting, so the claim cannot be immediately matched to an active policy. This triggers a rejection in the initial flow (the insurer’s system flags the FNOL for manual review or correction). The insured’s contact, Linda Garcia, is listed, but due to the policy number issue the claim is not accepted until the information is corrected. Once the policy details are verified (out of band), the claim can be processed. This case highlights a rejected FNOL flow due to invalid data.
•	Reporter Role: Other (property manager reporting on behalf of the insured). Henry is not the insured or broker, so sameAsReportedBy is false and the insured’s details are provided separately.
•	Loss Cause: Electrical fire in the kitchen (would be covered, but processing is delayed due to the policy info error).
•	Policy Number Issue: The policy number provided (CP-999-9999) was not found in the system, causing the FNOL submission to be rejected initially.
•	Authorities Notified: Yes, the fire department responded and helped extinguish the fire.
•	Outcome: Rejected flow – The FNOL did not automatically proceed due to incorrect policy information. The issue requires follow-up to correct the policy number. After correction, the claim would then be opened (but this follow-up step is outside the initial automated flow).
